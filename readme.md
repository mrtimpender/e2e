Standing for 'end to end', e2e is a commute time and cost estimation web application that aggregates data in realtime by utilizing the Google Maps and Uber APIs.  Once a user logs in, they can save their frequently travelled locations and establish a set of trips between those locations.  The application then pings the Google Maps and Uber APIs and aggregates data to estimate the average commute time and cost of said trip.
